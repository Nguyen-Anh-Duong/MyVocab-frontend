## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- User account with `ADMIN` role
- Backend API running with admin endpoints

### Accessing Admin Dashboard

1. **Login** with admin credentials
2. **Look for "Admin" link** in the header navigation
3. **Click "Admin"** to access the dashboard at `/admin`

### Admin Navigation

The admin system uses a dedicated layout with:

- **Sidebar navigation** (desktop)
- **Mobile-responsive** hamburger menu
- **Breadcrumb navigation** for easy orientation
- **Quick logout** from admin panel

## Admin Routes

```
/admin                    # Dashboard overview
/admin/users             # User management
/admin/vocabularies      # Vocabulary management
/admin/categories        # Category management
```

## Role Management

### User Roles

- **USER** - Standard user with basic vocabulary features
- **ADMIN** - Administrator with full system access

### Setting Up Admin Users

Currently, admin users must be set up through the backend API. The frontend admin system will display admin controls once a user has the `ADMIN` role.

- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure you're authenticated

**Data not loading?**

## Development Notes

### Current Implementation

- **Frontend-only** admin system with mock data
- **Role-based access** control implemented
- **Responsive design** with Tailwind CSS
- **TypeScript** for type safety

### API Integration

The admin system is designed to work with backend APIs:

- User management: `/api/admin/users`
- Vocabulary management: `/api/admin/vocabularies`
- Category management: `/api/admin/categories`
- Statistics: `/api/admin/stats`

### Architecture

- **Layout-based** routing with `AdminLayout`
- **Component-driven** design with reusable UI components
- **Hook-based** state management
- **Service layer** for API communication
